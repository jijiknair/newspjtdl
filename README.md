1.News Article Categorization Model
Introduction:
This project aims to develop a model that can categorize news articles into their respective categories. 
The dataset consists of news articles along with their corresponding categories. 
The goal is to preprocess the data, build a machine learning or deep learning model, and evaluate its performance.
1.loading the json training data and preprocessing it


2.DATA ANALYSIS
(a)Display basic information about the DataFrame
(b)	Handling Null Values:
•	Drop rows or columns with null values using the dropna() method.
•	Fill null values with a specific value using the fillna() method.
•	Impute null values based on mean, median, or mode of the column.
(c)Word count generation
A word cloud is a data visualization technique commonly used to represent the frequency of words in a text document. 
(d)Data Visualisation
Visulaize numbers of sections of data
(c)Url length analysis
(d)NLP analysis of data
(3)Choose an appropriate model and predicted the result.
(4)Real Time prediction of result using an unlabeled news article


2.News Article Categorization Model:
Code for Detecting if the news article is related to Palestine and categorize it under a new subcategory called "FreePalestine".


3.Abstractcreation:
Utilizes sumy library to generate a summary of a given article text using the LexRank algorithm.
